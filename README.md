# 🌦 Weather Website

A website that shows the weather prediction based on the location of the user. Works in any city in Indonesia.

This project is made as a practice for using APIs and geolocation.

Calculations for finding closest location can be a bit off as I use a flat plan formula (x & y axis) instead of latitude and longitude system 😅.

## ☀ Icons

Icons are made by myself, they are available to use in the [`Weather Icons`](https://github.com/ahmadzaki2975/Weather-Web/tree/main/public/Weather%20Icons) folder.
If you use them, make sure to credit me 😁.
